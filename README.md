# Description
Application process video and "in real time" match notes with their names. 
It was working, but has some disadvantages.
It was a little bit too slow to process video in real time. Processing one frame took about 5 seconds (depending on video resolution, but minimum resolution to work properly was 1080p). 
There were also problems when sheet of paper was bent.
